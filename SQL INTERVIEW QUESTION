1. what are ACID Property?
--> ACID Properties are used when you are multiple transaction handling in sql.

     1.Atomicity :- at the all trasaction execute or none execute
     2.Consistency :- all data inserted or Updated should be constain remain
     3.Isolation :- one transaction should not affect another transaction.
     4.Durability :- inserted or commited not must be lost even power cut.

2. what is CTE in SQL Server?
--> A common table expression, is a temporary named result set, that you can within a select,insert,update or delete statement.

         --engineers CTE Name
    WITH engineers as (
    select * from employees where dept='Engineering' --CTE body
    )
    

    Select * from engineers ---use CTE

3. What is the difference between Delete,Trancate and Drop Commands?
-->
        DELETE FROM Employees where Emp_Id = 7;

        TRUNCATE TABLE EMPLOYEES; 

        DROP TABLE EMPLOYEES;

          DELETE :- 1. it is a DML.
                    2. it is used to delete rows from the table based on where condition.
                    3. it will not delete schema only delete Data. of the table
                    4. it can be rollback.


           TRUNCATE :-1. It is a DDL
                      2. It is used to delete all rows from the table.
                      3. It wil not delete schema onle deleted data of the table.
                      4. trancate table it can not be rollback.

            DROP     :- 1. It is a DDL
                        2. It is used to delete rows from the table.
                        3. it will delete schema.
                        4. it can not be rollback

4. What is the difference between stored procedure and function ?
--> 

     Stored procedure :- 1. SP may or may not return a value.
                         2. SP can have both input/output parameters
                         3. SP can call function inside it
                         4. SP Cannot be embedded i SQL Statement like SELECT,INSERT etc.
                         5. SP can have try-catch exception handling inside it.
                         6. SP can use transactions inside it.

    function          :- 1. function must return value
                         2. function only has input parameters.
                         3. function cannot call SP inside it.
                         4. functions can be embedded in sql statements Select *,dbo.fnCountry(city.long) from city
                         5. Functions cannot have try-catch inside it.
                         6. functions cannot have transaction inside it.


5.What are Indexes in SQL Server?
--> SQL Indexes are used in relational databases to retrieve data very fast.

    for example :- it's similer to indexes start of the book index.

6. what is Non-Clustered index? how to create non-clustered index on a table?
--> 

   1.A non-clustered index is stored at one place and table data is stored in another place.

   for example :- it's similer to indexes start of the book index.

   2.a table can have multiple non-clustered index in a table.

   3.Unique key is a part of Non-Clustered index

   Query :- 

     CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX <index_name>
     ON <table_name>(<column_name> ASC/DESC)

7.What is Clustered Index? How to create clustered index?
--> 1. A Clustered index is a type of index that determines the physical order of data in a table.

     for example : - Discnery

     2. Table data can be sorted in only way, therefore, there can be only one clustered index per table.
     3. in sql server, if you set a primary key on column, then it will automatically create a clustered index on that particular column.
    

     CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX <index_name>
     On <table_Name>(<column_name> ASC/DESC)

8. what is the difference between scope_identity and @@identity?
--> 

    @@IDENTITY function returns the last identity value generated within the current session, regardless of the scope. (scope means when two entry going table symentensly some wrong id generated)

    The SCOPE_IDENTITY() function return the last identity created in the same session and the same scope. (but not this case)

9. how to optimize a stored precedure or SQL Query?
--> 

    1. Use SET NOCOUNT ON. (Set count taking more memory space)
    2. Specify column names instead of using *.
    3. Use schema name before objects or table names.
    4. Use EXISTS instead of COUNT()
    5. Use transaction when required only.
    6. Do not use dynamic queries they are vulnerable to sql injections.

10. what is a Cursor? why to avoid them?
-->     a database Cursor is a control which enables iteration over the row or records in the table or select statement.

   CASE
   @product_name VARCHAR(MAX),
   @list_price   DECIMAL;
   DECLARE CURSOR_PRODUCT CURSOR
   FOR SELECT Product_name,list_price FROM production.products;
   OPEN Cursor_Product;
   FETCH NEXT FROM Cursor_Product INTO
   @product_name,
   @list_price;

   WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
      BEGIN
         PRINT @Product_name + CAST(@lis_price AS varchar);
         FETCH NEXT FROM cursor_product INTO
          @product_name,
          @list_price;
     END;
     CLOSE Cursor_product;
     DEALLOCATE Cursor_product;

     Limitation :- 
                   A Cursor is memory resident set of pointers.

11.what is View ?

--> a View is a Virtual table which consists of a subset fo data contained in single or more than one table.

  Advntanges of views
  1. Indexed view improve the performance.
  2. Extra security :- DBA can hide the actual table names and expose views for Read operaions only.
  
12.what is the difference between having clause and where clause?
-->
    

    SELECT COUNT(CustomerID),Count FROM Customers
    FROM Customers
    WHERE Country = "India"
    GROUP BY Country
    HAVING COUNT (CustomerID) > 5;

    WHERE :- Where clause is used before group by clause.
             Where clasue cannot contain aggregate function.





    Having : - Having clause is used after group by clause.
               having clause can contain aggregate function.

13.what is a constraint is SQL? what are it's types of constraint?
--> SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.
    
    CREATE TABLE Students (
    ID int Not null primary key,
    name varchar(255) not null,
    courseId int foreign key references 
    age in not null check (age >= 18),
    admissionDate date Default getdate(),
    constraint UC_Student UNIQUE(ID,Name)
    
    );

14.what is the difference between primary key and unique key?
--> 

       Primary key :- 1.primary key can't accept null values.
                      2.Automatically create clustered index.
                      3.Only one primary key can be present in a table.





       Unique key :- 1.Unique key can accept only one null value.
                     2. Create non clustered index.
                     3. more than one unique key can be present in a table.


15.what are triggers?
--> triggers are stored programs, which are automatically executed or fired when some events (Insert,delete and update) occur.

  Example of After (DML) Trigger

  CREATE TRIGGER TR_UPD_Locations ON Locations
  FOR UPDATE
  NOT FOR REPLICATION
  AS
  BEGIN
    INSERT INTO LocationHist
    SELECT LocationID
    ,getdate() FROM inserted

  END

  16.What are the types of triggers?
  -->    
                           TRIGGERS
        DML                                        DDL            Logon --this are catogory of the trigger
                                                                 
Instead of triggers        after triggers         CREATE          Session logon event
Insert                     Insert                  ALTER
update                      Update                 Drop
delete                      Delete
                      

In after trigger, update on the table executed first and then after trigger will be fired.


CREATE TRIGGER [dbo].[TRG_VM_EMPDETAILS]
ON [dbo].[VW_EMPDETAILS]
INSTEAD OF INSERT
AS
BEGIN
   --Logic here 
END

instead of trigger allows you to skip an insert, delete, or update to a table and execute other statement defined in the trigger.


17. what is auto increments/identity column in sql server?
--> identity column or auto increament allows a uniques numbers to be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into a table.


18.what is sub query or nested query or inner query in sql ?
--> query inside query using where clause this sub query or nested query or inner query

19.what are joins in sql ?
--> a join clause is used to combine rows from two or more table , based on a related column between them.

20.what are the type of join?
--> left outer join :- a left join returns all the rows from the left table , along with any matching rows from the right table.

right outer join :- a right join returns all the row from the right table, along with any matching rows from the left table.

full outer join :- a full outer join returns all the rows from both the left and right table in the join.

inner join :- an inner join returns only the common rows from both tables that meet the join condition.

21. what is self-join?
--> a self join is a join of a table to itself.

22. what is Union in SQL Server?
--> Union operator is used to combine the result set of two or more SELECT statements.It merges the output of multiple queries into a single result set, ensuring that only destinct values are included by default.

for example : select City from customer
              Union
              select City from Suppliers

23. what is Cross Join?
 -- Cross join is operation that combines each row of one table with each two of another table, resulting in the cartersian product of the set of rows from the tables that are joined.

 Ex. Select * from student,Teacher

24. when to use out and when to use ref keyword?

--> Use out parameter to return a new and fresh value and use ref to modity an existing value.

25. what are the magic tables in sql?
--> Magic table are the temporary logical table that are created by the sql server, whenever there are insertion or deletion or upate(D.M.L) operations.

       1.Inserted :- when any insert query executed, then the recently inserted row gats added to the INSERTED magic table.

       2.DELETED : - when any delete query executed, then the recently deleted row gets added to the DELETED magic table.

       3.UPDATED :- In update case, the updated row get stored in inserted magic table and the old row or previous row get stored in the deleted magic table.
