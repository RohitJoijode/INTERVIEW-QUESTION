1. what are ACID Property?
--> ACID Properties are used when you are multiple transaction handling in sql.

     1.Atomicity :- at the all trasaction execute or none execute
     2.Consistency :- all data inserted or Updated should be constain remain
     3.Isolation :- one transaction should not affect another transaction.
     4.Durability :- inserted or commited not must be lost even power cut.

2. what is CTE in SQL Server?
--> A common table expression, is a temporary named result set, that you can within a select,insert,update or delete statement.

         --engineers CTE Name
    WITH engineers as (
    select * from employees where dept='Engineering' --CTE body
    )
    

    Select * from engineers ---use CTE

3. What is the difference between Delete,Trancate and Drop Commands?
-->
        DELETE FROM Employees where Emp_Id = 7;

        TRUNCATE TABLE EMPLOYEES; 

        DROP TABLE EMPLOYEES;

          DELETE :- 1. it is a DML.
                    2. it is used to delete rows from the table based on where condition.
                    3. it will not delete schema only delete Data. of the table
                    4. it can be rollback.


           TRUNCATE :-1. It is a DDL
                      2. It is used to delete all rows from the table.
                      3. It wil not delete schema onle deleted data of the table.
                      4. trancate table it can not be rollback.

            DROP     :- 1. It is a DDL
                        2. It is used to delete rows from the table.
                        3. it will delete schema.
                        4. it can not be rollback

4. What is the difference between stored procedure and function ?
--> 

     Stored procedure :- 1. SP may or may not return a value.
                         2. SP can have both input/output parameters
                         3. SP can call function inside it
                         4. SP Cannot be embedded i SQL Statement like SELECT,INSERT etc.
                         5. SP can have try-catch exception handling inside it.
                         6. SP can use transactions inside it.

    function          :- 1. function must return value
                         2. function only has input parameters.
                         3. function cannot call SP inside it.
                         4. functions can be embedded in sql statements Select *,dbo.fnCountry(city.long) from city
                         5. Functions cannot have try-catch inside it.
                         6. functions cannot have transaction inside it.


5.What are Indexes in SQL Server?
--> SQL Indexes are used in relational databases to retrieve data very fast.

    for example :- it's similer to indexes start of the book index.

6. what is Non-Clustered index? how to create non-clustered index on a table?
--> 

   1.A non-clustered index is stored at one place and table data is storedin another place.

   for example :- it's similer to indexes start of the book index.

   2.a table can have multiple non-clustered index in a table.

   3.Unique key is a part of Non-Clustered index

   Query :- 

     CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX <index_name>
     ON <table_name>(<column_name> ASC/DESC)

7.What is Clustered Index? How to create clustered index?
--> 1. A Clustered index is a type of index that determines the physical order of data in a table.

     for example : - Discnery

     2. Table data can be sorted in only way, therefore, there can be only one clustered index per table.
     3. in sql server, if you set a primary key on column, then it will automatically create a clustered index on that particular column.
    

     CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX <index_name>
     On <table_Name>(<column_name> ASC/DESC)

8. what is the difference between scope_identity and @@identity?
--> 

    @@IDENTITY function returns the last identity value generated within the current session, regardless of the scope. (scope means when two entry going table symentensly some wrong id generated)

    The SCOPE_IDENTITY() function return the last identity created in the same session and the same scope. (but not this case)

9. how to optimize a stored precedure or SQL Query?
--> 

    1. Use SET NOCOUNT ON. (Set count taking more memory space)
    2. Specify column names instead of using *.
    3. Use schema name before objects or table names.
    4. Use EXISTS instead of COUNT()
    5. Use transaction when required only.
    6. Do not use dynamic queries they are vulnerable to sql injections.

10. what is a Cursor? why to avoid them?
-->     a database Cursor is a control which enables iteration over the row or records in the table or select statement.

   CASE
   @product_name VARCHAR(MAX),
   @list_price   DECIMAL;
   DECLARE CURSOR_PRODUCT CURSOR
   FOR SELECT Product_name,list_price FROM production.products;
   OPEN Cursor_Product;
   FETCH NEXT FROM Cursor_Product INTO
   @product_name,
   @list_price;

   WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
      BEGIN
         PRINT @Product_name + CAST(@lis_price AS varchar);
         FETCH NEXT FROM cursor_product INTO
          @product_name,
          @list_price;
     END;
     CLOSE Cursor_product;
     DEALLOCATE Cursor_product;

     Limitation :- 
                   A Cursor is memory resident set of pointers.

11.what is View ?

--> a View is a Virtual table which consists of a subset fo data contained in single or more than one table.

  Advntanges of views
  1. Indexed view improve the performance.
  2. Extra security :- DBA can hide the actual table names and expose views for Read operaions only.
