1. what are	Service lifetime?
--> there are three main service lifetimes that determine how long a service instance lives and when a new instance is created:

    1.Transient Lifetime
                       
                        Registration : - AddTransient<TService, TImplementation>();
                        Behavior : - A new instance is created every time the service is requested.
                                    Each controller gets a fresh instance when it asks for one.

                        Use Case :-  1.Lightweight, stateless services
                                     2.Services where each consumer needs its own isolated instance.

    2.Scoped Lifetime 
                       Registration : - AddScoped<TService, TImplementation>();
                       Behavior     : - 1.One instance is created per client request (scope).
                                        2.The same instance is reused throughout a single HTTP request.
                                        3.Different requests get different instances.

                        Use Case: - 1.Entity Framework DbContext (default in ASP.NET Core).
                                    2.Services that need to maintain state during a single request

    3.Singleton Lifetime
                        Registration:-  AddSingleton<TService, TImplementation>();
                        Behavior: -1.A single instance is created for the entire application lifetime.
                                   2.The same instance is used for all requests.
                                   3.Lives until the application shuts down

                        Use Case:
                                    1.Memory cache
                                    2.Application configuration
                                    3.Services that maintain global state

2.Describe the service Lifetimes in asp.net core? or what is the difference between AddSingleton,AddScoped && AddTransient?
--> Service lifetime describe for how long the instance of any class will persist.

AddSingleton : - create only one instance when the service is requested for firsttime. and then the same instance will be shared by all different http requests.

AddScoped :- Create single instance for each request. for a different http request there will be a different instance.

AddTransient : - this instance is not shared at all, every time a new instance will be created.
